                    <p class="section-about-page-content-text">Given the importance of our culture and mission, we have decided to approach franchising in a careful manner. Rather than develop a large network of individual franchisees, we have decided that a small network of partners would better accomplish our goals and create a more cohesive brand. Our network, based on human values and friendly relationships, strives to be a positive force in the communities we serve. We consider our partners more as family than as a group of business relations. Weâ€™re confident that they will help strengthen our culture and that together we will build a better business than we could on our own.</p>
